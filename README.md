# build2learn
Welcome to the build2learn repository. 

The purpose of this repository is to provide a resource for documentation and source code for the build2learn session(s) at [Pascal PDX](https://www.pascalpdx.org/).

The general idea of these sessions is to take several categories of tools, analyze their functionality, and re-implement them using _your_ language of choice.
