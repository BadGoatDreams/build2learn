# build2learn
Welcome to the build2learn repository. 

The purpose of this repository is to provide a resource for documentation and source code for the build2learn session(s) at [Pascal PDX](https://www.pascalpdx.org/).

The general idea of these sessions is to take several categories of tools, analyze their functionality, and re-implement them using _your_ language of choice.

### Session_0
The purpose of Session_0:
* Help individuals setup their development environment
* Make sure that the git workflow is well understood
* Help with a language selection

While there will not be any _prescribed_ languages,we suggest either python or javascript. This is not to deter the use of other languages. Just to suggest that there may be more help available using something listed above.

### Contributing
Contributing is done by utilizing the standard [fork and pull request workflow](https://reflectoring.io/github-fork-and-pull/). Also please add your name to the [contributors.md](./contributors.md) file.
